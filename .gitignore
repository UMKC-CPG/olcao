# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore directories that will contain install databases and binaries
/share
/bin

# Ignore directories that will contain compiled object files
/build/release/*
/build/debug/*
