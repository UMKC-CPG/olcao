# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'
bin/

# Ignore directories that will contain install databases and binaries
/share
/bin

# Ignore directories that will contain compiled object files
/build
/build/*

# ignore the olcao config file. Note that this file is checked in,
# but the changes are ignored so that a user can set the variable
# to the things that make sense for their installation.
.olcao

# ignore the external folder. This is a uniform place to put all the
# things external to OLCAO but are meant to be used with olcao.
/external
/external/*
