   !
   ! A key aspect of OLCAO is that the charge density is cast into the form of
   !   a sum of atom centered Gaussian functions.  This form will allow for
   !   easy evaluation of the Coulomb electrostatic potential energy and the
   !   exchange-correlation energy.  Casting the valence charge density into
   !   the form of atom centered Gaussian functions follows a very similar
   !   procedure to the one used for the core charge density.  A set of
   !   equations is produced that relates the overlap of every Gaussian pair
   !   and the overlap between each Gaussian and the exact charge density
   !   represenstation (square of the solid state wave function).  In this
   !   subroutine, the overlap between each Gaussian pair including the
   !   Gaussians from image cells in the lattice are accumulated.  Note, that
   !   this matrix is real and symmetric and hence we really only need the
   !   upper triangle.  (This is the potAlphaOverlap matrix.) 

   ! To make the coulomb potential matrices we first create a smaller set of
   !   matrices.  This set of matrices is created for each possible combination
   !   of non-equivalent potential types.  The matrices are essentially factors
   !   that are constant during the lattice vector loop.  Each pair of
   !   potential sites runs through the hundred or so real space lattice
   !   vectors.

   ! It is also useful that these matrices only have to be calculated each time
   !   the potential sites change to a different potential type.  However,
   !   (although still useful for the lattice vector loop) this becomes less
   !   efficient when the number of potential types grows, especially with
   !   respect to the number of potential sites.

   ! In this light, there are a couple of ways that this can be sped up.
   !1) The matrices will be symmetric in the case that the two sets of
   !   potential alphas currently under consideration are the same. This
   !   would occur in the case of more than one potential type representing
   !   the same element (e.g. ca1 and ca2 from fluorapatite).
   !2) The matrices for every identical pair of elements will be identical.
   !   (e.g. The matrix formed from o1 and o2 from fluorapatite will be the
   !   exact same as the matrix formed by (o1,o3), and (o2,o3).  Also, the
   !   matrix formed by (ca1,o1) will be the same as the matrix set formed by
   !   (ca1,o2), (ca1,o3), (ca2,o1), (ca2,o2), and (ca3,o3).  etc.

   ! So, a little more complexity can reduce the number of times these must be
   !   calculated.  For small systems with only a few dozen types this is
   !   clearly of little consequence and not a prioriety yet.  However, if we
   !   later wish to do much larger systems with hundreds of types and
   !   thousands of sites such an improvement may be useful.

   ! The basic algorithm here is to consider the interaction between the
   !   Gaussians on each potential site (i) and the Gaussians on each other
   !   potential site (j) possibly in another replicated cell (k).  The
   !   exponential term in the Gaussian is used as a measure for the degree of
   !   interaction such that when this value reaches some threshold the level
   !   of interaction is considered to be negligable and any further
   !   interaction integrals can be disregarded.
   ! Some details are as follows:  The exponential alphas for the Gaussians
   !   at each site are arranged in monotonically increasing order.  The
   !   interactions between any pair of sites proceeds by consideration of the
   !   two longest ranged Gaussians first (one from each site).  If these two
   !   Gaussians are determined to have a non-negligable interaction then the
   !   interaction intergrals for this pair are computed.  Then the longest
   !   ranged Gaussian from site i and all the other Gaussians from the other
   !   site j are used for calculation.  Then the longest ranged Gaussian from
   !   site j and all the other Gaussians from the other site i are used for
   !   calculation.  (This is the first column, and then the first row of the
   !   interaction matrix between these two sites.)  Then the second longest
   !   ranged Gaussians of both sites are considered and the same procedure
   !   is used.  The second column and second row are computed (excluding the
   !   interaction with the longest ranged Gaussian because that was already
   !   done).  This proceeds down the diagonal of the matrix until at some
   !   point two Gaussians on the diagonal pass the threshold and have a
   !   negligable interaction.  At this point the algorithm stops for this
   !   pair of sites and the next site (j) in replicated cell (k) is chosen.
   ! In most cases the negligability limit will be reached before all the
   !   Gaussian pairs are considered.  This is because the diagonal elements
   !   (which are used to determine the negligability limit) represent shorter
   !   and shorter ranged Gaussians as the calculation proceeds.  Indeed, the
   !   the chance that the negligability limit will be reached before the final
   !   pair of Gaussians for a particular pair of sites is almost 100%.  The
   !   later Gaussians are very narrow and not broad at all.  The only time
   !   that *all* the Gaussians from a particular site pair will have non-
   !   negligable overlap is when the two sites are actually the same site in
   !   the original cell.  In this case all Gaussians will be the same and even
   !   the most sharp will overlap.
   ! In the past the program allowed for the use of auxiliary potential sites
   !   that were not associated with atomic sites.  This method has not been
   !   used in a very long time due to the arbitrary nature of when, how many,
   !   and where to add the auxiliary functions.  However, if they were added,
   !   then it would be possible to not reach the negligability limit before
   !   they were almost all considered (note the tricky aspect that the first
   !   alpha loop only goes to numAlphas - 1 or so).  Imagine only 3 or so very
   !   broad Gaussians at some auxiliary site and you could see how this might
   !   happen.  Now, in the future I may add the ability to have auxiliary
   !   functions back in to the OLCAO method, but at the moment that will be
   !   a lot more trouble than it is worth because it was rarely used, rather
   !   arbitrary, and there are some considerable computational efficiencies
   !   that have been developed *assuming* that all potential (charge) sites
   !   map to atomic sites too.  Still, we will keep this current algorithm
   !   because it isn't all that bad even for our now simpler case of no
   !   auxiliary functions.
