! The population is done in two phases.  The first phase uses the old
!   standard technique and does not apply any thermal smearing to the
!   populated levels.  This phase is done ONLY to obtain the minimum
!   energy level that should be populated (which is trivial), and the
!   maximum energy level that should be populated (which is not trivial in
!   multi kpoint and excited state environments).

! The basic problem of doing spin polarized populations and also multi-
!   kpoint populations is that you don't know what the order of states is.
!   Is the lowest energy from kpoint #1 or kpoint #2?  How about the second
!   or third lowest?  Is the spin up from state #1 of kpoint #1 higher
!   energy than the spin down from state #2 of kpoint #1?  What about mixed
!   kpoints?

! The solution used here is to sort all the energy states and keep track of
!   where they came from.

! 1)  Split the energy levels on the first iteration of the SCF cycle for
!     spin polarized calculations only.
! 2)  Copy all the energy values into a 1 dimensional temp array.  The order
!     of the indices is important.  The values are put in by state first,
!     then spin, and finally kpoints.  So for a 4 state, 2 spin, 2 kpoint
!     system we would have:  111, 211, 311, 411, 121, 221, 321, 421, 112,
!     212, 312, 412, 122, 222, 322, 422.  Where the first digit of the
!     triplet is the state, the second is the spin, and the third is the
!     kpoint.   In the linear array the values are grouped first by their
!     kpoint (e.g. the first 8 are kpoint 1, and the second 8 are kpoint 2.)
!     Then, within the kpoint groups the values are grouped by spin.  (e.g.
!     the first 4 are spin up and the second 4 are spin down.)  Finally,
!     within the spin groups, the values are ordered by their state number.
!     This list is grouped, but not sorted.
! 3)  Sort the energy eigen values into a new array:
!     sortedEnergyEigenValues.  A mapping is created between the sorted
!     values and the original values grouped by kpoints, then spin, and then
!     state.  The mapping is held in indexEnergyEigenValues.  The index
!     number for this array corresponds to the index number for the sorted
!     array.  The value in the array is the index of the original unsorted
!     array.  (e.g. sortedArray = (2, 3, 6, 8) originalArray = (3, 6, 8, 2),
!     indexArray(1) = 4, indexArray(2) = 1, indexArray(3) = 2, and
!     indexArray(4) = 3.
! 4)  Now, the electron population for each state/kpoint/spin set is
!     computed.  The electron population array is one dimensional and the
!     indices for this array match the indices for the original unsorted
!     energy eigen value array.  The electron population for each triplet is
!     is then assigned IN THE ORDER OF THE INDEX ARRAY.  This will make the
!     lowest energy triplit the first to be populated, and the second lowest
!     triplet the next to be populated, etc.  ONE CATCH!  The amount of
!     electron popultion to go into a given triplet depends on which kpoint
!     that triplet includes.  FORTUNATELY, we thought ahead and grouped the
!     values according to their kpoint.  So, we just have to do a simple
!     integer division to get the kpoint number:
!     e.g. 1+(indexArray(i)-1) / (numStates*spin).  Once the cumulative
!     number of electrons is the same as the number of electrons in the
!     system, we abort the loop.
! 5)  There is one issue with the highest occupied state.  If it turns out
!     that this state is degenerate, then we need to distribute the charge
!     in all degenerate states evenly.  This will prevent the case of some
!     states being occupied while others at the same energy level are
!     totally unoccupied.  We find which states have the same energy and
!     then distribute the charge evenly among them by summing the total
!     charge that exists in the degenerate states and summing the total
!     charge that could be put in the degenerate states if they were all
!     completely filled.  Then, each state gets an amount of charge equal to
!     the kPoint weight of that state times the ratio of total existing over
!     total possible charge.  (NOTE that this scheme is NOT applied to the
!     thermal smearing phase.)
! 6)  The thermal smearing scheme is basically the same except that the
!     population is modified by the fermi function.
! 7)  The case of xanes calculation is also basically the same except that
!     we consider the system to have one extra electron, and then we remove
!     an electron from a core orbital after the system was completely
!     populated.

   ! In the case where the level number is equal to the level number that has

   !   remove one electron worth of population value from each kpoint at the
   !   core excitation level.  This will put the excited electron in the lowest

   ! Compute the number of energy eigen value terms.
   numSegments = numStates * numKPoints * spin

   ! So the basic idea here is to make two posts that bound the possible
   !   values of the fermi energy. The first guess for the fermi energy is in
   !   the exact middle between the two posts. (Which will be in the middle of
   !   the gap for an insulator.) Then we apply the smearing function and if
   !   the integrated charge is too small we bring the minimum post up to the
   !   current guess and if the integrated charge is too large we bring the
   !   maximum post down to the current guess. Then we make a new guess between
   !   the posts and evaluate the smearing function all over again.

   ! The first guess will be pretty close to correct for most systems. In the
   !   case of most insulators with a gap this will put the fermi level right
   !   in the middle of the gap and it will be correct on the first iteration.
   !   In the case of metals or small gap semiconductors it may be close but
   !   wrong on the first iteration. Then one border post will shift a lot (by
   !   moving to the point of the zeroth fermi level guess) and the integrated
   !   charge will be wrong for a few iterations while the two border posts
   !   move closer to each other.

   ! The process may be envisioned in the following sequence of interations in
   !   the loop over variable i. Consider that the first guess integrates to a
   !   charge that is too high. The high post moves in and the low post stays.
   !   The new guess (1) will probably be way too low (the integrated charge
   !   will be < the number of electrons). The low post moves up and the new
   !   guess is made at (2) for the fermi level. In the figures we assume that
   !   each of the subsequent guesses are too low (producing an integrated
   !   charge that is too small). Thus, steps 3 and 4 are moves of the lower
   !   post. Eventually, it will find a situation that is neither too high or
   !   too low. This is the appropriate fermi level.
