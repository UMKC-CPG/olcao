# PROGRAM: makeReactions
# PURPOSE: To create a set of pre- and post-reaction molecule files along with
#    a mapping file for a bond/react based LAMMPS calculation.
# ALGORITHM: This program requires two directories as input that each identify
#    a precursor molecule type. It will then create a new directory based on
#    the combination of their names. Inside that new directory, it will copy
#    OLCAO skeleton input files from the originally identifies directories and
#    will then process them to create pre- and post-reaction files along with
#    a mapping file.
#
#    Each input skeleton file is parsed to find and record all of its H atoms
#    and to identify the set of atoms attached to each H atom that should be
#    included in the list of the atoms to be deleted upon molecule bonding.
#    That list is called the "delete list". Unless specified otherwise it is
#    assumed that only the individual H atoms will be part of the delete list.
#    If it is desired to have more atoms in the delete list then the -d1 and
#    -d2 options can be used to delete more atoms from molecules 1 and 2
#    respectively. In the default assumption the H atoms between the two
#    molecules will be the points at which new bonds will be identified and
#    formed. The physical vision is that the H atoms will break off to form H_2
#    and the remaining bare atoms will bond. (In the simulation, the H_2 is
#    never actually created. Instead the two H atoms are just deleted when the
#    molecules bond.) For larger tree depths, whole tree is removed.
#
#    Once all the atoms in both molecules have been cataloged, then the second
#    molecule will be systematically translated and oriented so that each of
#    its H atoms would be in a proper position for reacting with each of the H
#    atoms in the first molecule. Once so translated and rotated for a given H,
#    then the skeleton files for molecule1 and the modified molecule2 are
#    merged into a single file.
#
#    At this point two product files are created that are suitable molecule
#    files for use in LAMMPS bond/react calculations. The first is the
#    pre-reaction molecule file that contains relevant segments of both
#    molecules (where "relevant" is determined by the chain-length variable
#    which is 4 by default so as to include the atom bonded to an H atom, the
#    next nearest neighbor atoms, and the next-next nearest neighbor atoms).
#    The second is the post-reaction molecule. We use a default chain length of
#    4 because we will change angles to the atom bonded to the H atom. Those
#    H-bonded atoms might be part of an angle that goes "two bonds deeper" into
#    the molecule. (E.g., Consider the molecule: H-B-C-X. Because we want to
#    modify the B atom and we need to account for angles, we must include the X
#    atom in the template because of a possible B-C-X bond angle.)
#
#    The atomic structure (number of atoms and their coordiates) are the same
#    in both files. The difference is in the information about their bonding
#    patterns (topology). When it is time for both the pre- and post-reaction
#    LAMMPS files to be created the OLCAO skeleton file containing the merged
#    pair of molecules is read, bonds and bond angles are analyzed, and a
#    subset of the original atoms from the skeleton file are taken according to
#    a chain-length variable.
#
# The -m1 option defines the name of the first molecule directory that must
#    contain an OLCAO skeleton input file. The -m2 does the same for the second
#    molecule directory. IMPORTANT: An extremely important assumption is that
#    each molecule given in a skeleton file uses space group 1_a. I.e., all
#    atomic coordinates should be specified explicitly. Additionally, they
#    should be given in cartesian coordiantes. This option is required. There
#    are no default values that can be assumed. Also note that the order of
#    molecules is not important because they will be sorted so that the -m1
#    molecule is always alphanumerically before the -m2 molecule.
#
# The -c1 option defines the chain length variable \$chainLen1 that is used to
#    reduce (prune) the number of atoms in the full molecules. That action will
#    save time during a LAMMPS simulation when it seeks reaction template
#    matches. This variable defines the number of atoms (starting at the point
#    of "contact" between the two molecules) to include in the reaction
#    template from molecule 1. The -c2 option defines the same for molecule 2.
#    This does not include the point of contact atoms. So, if the binding
#    If the molecules are CH4 and B10C2H12 and the contact points are an H atom
#    bound to the C atom from CH4 and a B or a C atom from B10C2H12. Then a
#    -c1 of 3 would include the H atom bound to the central C atom, the central
#    C atom of the CH4 itself, and all three other H atoms. A -c2 of 2 would
#    include the H atom bound to either a B or C atom then the B or C atom
#    itself. Further, a -c2 of 3 would additionally include each of the
#    neighboring B or C atoms to the bound B or C atom. By default the chain
#    length values are set to 4 for both molecules.
#
# The -d1 option defines the delete tree depth variable \$delTreeDepth1 and the
#    \$delTreeTarget element_species that is used to remove atoms from the
#    molecules upon binding. Consider a molecule with the following form where
#    we assume that all elements are of type 1 and that the far left H atom
#    is the trigger atom for initiating binding:
#
#           H       H
#           |       |
#      H  H-C-H   H-C-H  H
#      |    |       |    |
#    H-C---Si---N---Si---C-H
#      |    |       |    |
#      H  H-C-H   H-C-H  H
#           |       |
#           H       H
#
#    If the option "-d1 1 si_1" is used then the far left CH3 group will be
#    added to the delete tree and the left Si will be the binding point. If the
#    option "-d1 2 n_1" is used then all atoms to the left of the N will be
#    added to the delete tree and the N will be the binding point. As another
#    unlikely but technically possible example, if the option "-d1 2 c_1" is
#    used then either the top left or bottom left CH3 group will be the only
#    atoms *not* added to the delete tree and the C in that group will be the
#    binding point. (That outcome assumes that both C are type 1.) By default
#    the depth value is zero and so the target does not need to be specified.
#    In that case the atom directly bonded to an H atom is the target. If any
#    depth greater than zero is specified, then it is necessary to also specify
#    the element and species that is the end of the tree.
#
# The -h option defines the distance that H atoms will be separated from each
#    other when the templates are created. By default the H atom separation is
#    0.5. It is assumed that when the pre- and post-reaction molecule files are
#    created the H atoms that are "in contact" with each other will not be
#    included.
#
# The -uptypes switch will request that when molecules merge the type numbers
#    of the atoms that bind are increased. By default this option is off so
#    that atom types definitions given in the molecule skeleton files will
#    remain constant throughout the simulation.
# The -help option gives this help.

#         #   is different from the first, then the species numbers need to be
#         #   greater than the species number of any atoms from the first
#         #   molecule of the same element. I.e., if mol1 and mol2 are not the
#         #   same, then c1 from mol1 and c1 from mol2 need to be distinguished
#         #   from each other. The fix is to make c1 from mol2 become c2
#         #   (assuming that there are no other c species in this example).
#         # (2) If the atoms are going to be bonded to each other in the post-
#         #   reaction template, then the atoms to be bonded need to be of a
#         #   different (higher) species number than they would be in the pre-
#         #   reaction template. I.e., c1 from mol1 and b1 from mol2 will need
#         #   to become c2 and b2 assuming that there wasn't already a c2 or b2.
#         #   If there was, then they would just become c3 or b3 instead. Also,
#         #   if there is only one single atom of type c1, then we *still* need
#         #   to make it be a c2 in the post-reaction template because the pre-
#         #   and post-reaction templates must integrate smoothly. A tricky
#         #   aspect is that we will need to apply the (2) case *after* fixing
#         #   the numbers for all atoms for the (1) case. This is because we
#         #   will not know the maximum species ID number for a given element
#         #   until after they have all been assigned for the pre-reaction case.

# One of the tasks to be executed here includes reading a bondAnalysis.bl file

# The reaction requires a pre- and a post-reaction template as well as a map
#   file that relates the two.
#   (1) The pre-reaction template requires nearby H-H atoms from different
#       molecules (with no bonds between the molecules).
#   (2) The post-reaction template deletes those H atoms and then binds the two
#       (now bare) atoms that the H atoms were bonded to.
#
# Pre-reaction template:
#
# This template will contain all atoms in the pruned file and it will contain
#   all bonds among atoms of the originally distinct molecules, but it will
#   not have any bonds that connect the two originally distinct molecules. All
#   elements (masses) and all types will be assigned as per the pruned skeleton
#   file. For the reaction to occur in the simulation, then an H atom from
#   one molecule will need to be in close proximity to an H atom from the other
#   molecule. (There are no bonds between the molecules at this time.) All
#   bonds and bond angles within each pruned molecule are given explicitly.
#
# Post-reaction template:
#
# This template will contain all the same atoms as in the pre-reaction
#   template. However, all bonds and bond angles that used to include either H
#   atom will now be removed. Presently, one new bond between the now bare
#   atoms that were bonded to the H atoms is added but no new bond angles are
#   added. So, the newly bonded molecules may be somewhat floppy until that is
#   fixed. A tricky aspect though is that the *types* of the atoms and bonds
#   will be changed. The type of the atom that was bonded to the H atom will
#   be changed, as will the type of the bond that it had with any neighbor.
#   This will re-define the topology of the combined molecule.
#
# Template map file:
#
# All atoms in the pre-reaction template are the same as those in the post
#   reaction template. Therefore, there will be one equivalency for each atom
#   and the equivalencies will all be of the type 1 1, 2 2, 3 3, etc. The
#   bonding IDs will be the atom numbers of the two atoms that were bonded to
#   the H atoms. The H atoms will be classified as DeleteIDs. The edge IDs will
#   be all edges that were found when pruning the molecule.

         #   to all of the atoms uniquely so that we can control the bond/react
         #   activity in detail.

         #   molecules and the current pair of bonding atoms (because that is
         #   really all we can possibly know for sure about what *might* be

         #   the possible reaction templates are combined together for the full
         #   LAMMPS simulation.
